# Test application for Int20 hackathon.
Powered by React Native & Flashback team *ðŸ‘½*

## Description

Music Akinator application for Int20 hackathon.

The application has a game-like experience in which game lasts for 5 rounds.
In each round uses thinks of a song & enters it's lyrics. Then the app tries to guess that song & provides Title, Name & In-app youtube preview.
Then user says if it was guessed correctly. If yes - the app earns a point, otherwise - a user.
After the 5th round, the app shows the result & resets it's state.

In case an app can't find the song - the "Not Found ðŸ˜¢" message is showed for a couple of seconds,
but no side actually gains the point & round is restarted.
